<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a third-year Ph.D student in Idefix team, the Department of Applied Mathematics at [Ensta Paris](https://uma.ensta-paris.fr/idefix/). My Ph.D supervisor is [Dr. Jing-Rebecca LI](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~jingrebeccali/) and my Ph.D topic is **Numerical methods to estimate brain micro-structure from diffusion MRI data**. 

My research interests include **diffusion MRI**, **Bloch-Torrey equation**, **finite element**, **asymptotic model** and **microstrucral imaging**.

I obtained my Master degree and diplôme d'ingénieur in electrical engineering, at École Centrale de Pékin. My works are related to **Bayesian optimization** and **plane wave generator design**.

Here is my complete Curriculum vitae [in English](./assets/cv/Zheyi_Yang_CV_en.pdf) and [in French](./assets/cv/Zheyi_Yang_CV_fr.pdf).
