<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a third-year Ph.D student in Idefix team, the Department of Applied Mathematics at [Ensta Paris](https://uma.ensta-paris.fr/idefix/). My Ph.D supervisor is [Dr. Jing-Rebecca LI](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~jingrebeccali/) and my Ph.D topic is **Numerical methods to estimate brain micro-structure from diffusion MRI data**. 

My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **machine learning** -- with a special focus on building intelligent visual systems that are continual and data-efficient. My research interests include **3D geometry models**, and **medical imaging**.

<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600"><strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600">I am currently on the 2023-2024 academic job market, looking for post-doc positions in Applied math, related to Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested. I am also happy to give talks on my research in related seminars.</strong></strong>
